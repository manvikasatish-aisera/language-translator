A blessing in disguise
A dime a dozen
Beat around the bush
Better late than never
Bite the bullet
Break the ice
Burn the midnight oil
By the skin of your teeth
Caught between a rock and a hard place
Cut corners
Cutting-edge technology
Devil's advocate
Don't count your chickens before they hatch
Every cloud has a silver lining
Find your feet
Hit the nail on the head
In the heat of the moment
Jump on the bandwagon
Kill two birds with one stone
Let the cat out of the bag
Miss the boat
"No pain, no gain"
On the ball
Once in a blue moon
Piece of cake
Put all your eggs in one basket
Spill the beans
Take it with a grain of salt
The ball is in your court
The best of both worlds
The last straw
Throw caution to the wind
Under the weather
Up in the air
When pigs fly
Wrap your head around something
You canâ€™t judge a book by its cover
Your guess is as good as mine
